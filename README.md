I developed a simple Data Compression Tool using the C programming language to understand how file content can be reduced in size using basic algorithms. The program reads input from a text file and compresses repeating characters using techniques like run-length encoding (RLE). For example, a sequence like AAAABBB becomes A4B3, helping save storage space. The code is modular and uses standard C libraries like stdio.h and stdlib.h for file handling and memory operations. I compiled and ran the program using the Clang compiler on macOS, and wrote the code in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with C extension support. This project gave me practical experience in handling files, working with strings and character arrays, and understanding the logic behind basic data compression methods.
